VAR-SOM-MX8 and VAR-SOM-MX8X GPIO tests rely on a special test SD card that is currently based on Yocto Sumo release.
It differs from standard Sumo recovery SD card by modified the DTB files that change alternate functions of some pins
for the purpose of GPIO test. These special DTBs are required as GPIO alternate functions are controlled by SCFW and cannot
be modified at runtime using memtool, as is done on 8M products.

The modified DTSI files are: 
https://github.com/varjig/linux-imx-jig/blob/imx8x-imx_4.14.98_2.0.0_ga_var01/arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-imx8qm-var-som-common-kit-gpiotest.dtsi
https://github.com/varjig/linux-imx-jig/blob/imx8x-imx_4.14.98_2.0.0_ga_var01/arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-imx8qxp-var-som-common-kit-gpiotest.dtsi

To generate DTB files for GPIO test these modified DTSI files should be copied over
https://github.com/varigit/linux-imx/blob/imx_4.14.98_2.0.0_ga_var01/arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-imx8qm-var-som-common.dtsi
and
https://github.com/varigit/linux-imx/blob/imx_4.14.98_2.0.0_ga_var01/arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-imx8qxp-var-som-common.dtsi

respectively. VAR-SOM-MX8/VAR-SOM-MX8X DTB files should be rebuilt and copied to relevant Sumo recovery cards.
